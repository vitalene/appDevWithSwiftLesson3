//: ## Viewing Playground Results
//: What if you define a long string in a playground? You‚Äôll notice that the longer string is cut off at the end in the results sidebar. üëâ
//:
let spelledOutNumber = "fifty"
let meal = "second breakfast"
let aliceQuotation = "Why, sometimes I‚Äôve believed as many as \(spelledOutNumber) impossible things before \(meal)!"
//: In the results sidebar, move the cursor to point at the line that begins as ‚ÄúWhy, sometimes I‚Äôve believed‚Äù. When you do, that result will become highlighted and two controls will appear:
//: ![Sidebard Controls](SidebarControls.png)
//: Click the control that looks like an eye. This is the QuickLook control. A popover will appear showing you the full string value.
//: 
//: Move the pointer over the control that looks like an empty circle. A plus sign will appear. If you click the plus sign, the result of that line of code is added right in the playground. You can click this control again, which will now look like a cross, to hide the result.
//:
//: For now, leave the result of the long string showing. Change the values of name and language. Notice how the result changes inline in the playground.
//:
//: On the next page, take these strings even further.
