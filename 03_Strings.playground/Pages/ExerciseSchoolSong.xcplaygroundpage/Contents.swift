 ## Go Fight Win!
 
 Many schools have “fight songs”: Students learn a non-zero number of the words, and then sing the songs together loudly at school events like sports games.
 
 You’ve decided that your school song needs a rewrite, though, and are editing the song in code so you don’t have to copy-paste as much while you iterate.
 
 1. Edit the `song` to have more than a repeated refrain.
 2. Edit the `refrain` to have actual words; people may mumble them later, but for now you are a committed lyricist.
 3. Edit the `refrain` to use the `schoolName` at least twice.
 4. Test your work by changing the school name to a fictional magical school.
 
 Use string interpolation in case you decide to market your brilliant song to other groups.
 
 - note:
 Use the “show result” button so you can see the results of your work.

let schoolName = "fictional magic school"
let refrain = "hmm hmm HMMM hm-hmm \(schoolName) hmm hmm HMMMMM \(schoolName)"

let song = "\(refrain)\n\(refrain)\nYes, \(refrain)"
